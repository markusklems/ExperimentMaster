# Setup a Ganglia Cluster
# 

# Read the Configuration Guide for more info:
# http://whirr.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration-guide.html 

# Change the cluster name here
whirr.cluster-name=ganglia

# Change the number of machines in the cluster here
# Also, setting up a cluster just for the sake of monitoring doesn't make much sense :)
whirr.instance-templates=1 ganglia-metad, 2 ganglia-monitor

# Setup your cloud credentials by copying conf/credentials.sample
# to ~/.whirr/credentials and editing as needed

# By default use the user system SSH keys. Override them here.
